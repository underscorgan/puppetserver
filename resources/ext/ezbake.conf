# NOTE: I'm no longer certain whether or not it actually makes sense to keep this
# file in this repo.  When we have to do preinst stuff, we get into a situation
# where we need to do some kind of variable interpolation into the commands
# that we're expressing here... and it's starting to feel like we just have
# too many levels of indirection going on.  Maybe this stuff should just be
# kept directly in the ezbake repo.
